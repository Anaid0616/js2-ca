### Introduction

Social Media (CRUD + Extras)

A functional, responsive Vanilla JS social media app built during the JavaScript 2 course at Noroff. Users can register, log in, create/read/update/delete their own posts, and interact with others via follow/unfollow, reactions, and comments. The app consumes the Noroff Social API and focuses on clean app logic, API integration, and an easy-to-use UI.
